# SistemaReservas

## Description

This desktop application, named in Spanish, is a reservation system designed for a Christian association in Costa Rica. The association offers religious events in two different rooms at their facility, 
multiple days a week, which most of the community attends. The application's goal is to allow users to choose the room they want to be in, select their desired seats, and provide a phone number to receive 
seat numbers and complete the reservation. The app is meant to be used in the association’s lobby, minutes before the event.
